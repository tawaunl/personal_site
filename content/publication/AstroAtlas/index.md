abstract: |
  Astrocytes play a pivotal role in central nervous system homeostasis 
  and neuroinflammation. Despite advancements in single-cell analyses, 
  the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases,
  particularly across species, remains understudied. Here, we present an
  integrated atlas of 187,000 astrocytes from mouse models of Alzheimer’s (AD)
  and multiple sclerosis (MS) alongside 438,000 astrocytes from AD, MS, and
  Parkinson’s (PD) patients. Our analysis identified four distinct mouse
  astrocyte clusters, including two disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) clusters,
  DAA1 and DAA2. DAA1 displayed reactivity resembling responses to acute stimuli,
  including endotoxemia, while DAA2 expressed well-known AD risk genes.
  In an AD model, DAA1 and DAA2 exhibited distinct spatial relationships
  to amyloid plaques. In humans, we identified eight distinct astrocyte clusters,
  encompassing homeostatic and disease-associated subtypes. Cross-species analysis
  linked disease-associated clusters while also highlighting divergent expression
  in others. Our astrocyte atlas is available through a user-friendly, searchable
  website: http://research-pub.gene.com/AstroAtlas/.
