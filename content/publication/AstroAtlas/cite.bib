	abstract = {Astrocytes play a pivotal role in central nervous system homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Despite advancements in single-cell analyses, the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly across species, remains understudied. Here, we present an integrated atlas of 187,000 astrocytes from mouse models of Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) alongside 438,000 astrocytes from AD, MS, and Parkinson{\textquoteright}s (PD) patients. Our analysis identified four distinct mouse astrocyte clusters, including two disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) clusters, DAA1 and DAA2. DAA1 displayed reactivity resembling responses to acute stimuli, including endotoxemia, while DAA2 expressed well-known AD risk genes. In an AD model, DAA1 and DAA2 exhibited distinct spatial relationships to amyloid plaques. In humans, we identified eight distinct astrocyte clusters, encompassing homeostatic and disease-associated subtypes. Cross-species analysis linked disease-associated clusters while also highlighting divergent expression in others. Our astrocyte atlas is available through a user-friendly, searchable website: http://research-pub.gene.com/AstroAtlas/.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
