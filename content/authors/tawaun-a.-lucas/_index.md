Hello, I'm Dr. Tawaun A. Lucas, a computational biologist with a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Stanford University. Currently, I am a Senior Computational Biologist at Biohub (formerly Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), where I work at the intersection of biology research and AI/ML model development to build scientific products and scalable computational workflows for biomedical research. My work focuses on addressing biological questions through applying models and developing computational workflows, to drive translational impact within human biology, immunology, and disease biology. I collaborate with teams of scientists, engineers, and product staff to ensure scientific validity and usability of computational biology tools.

With a strong foundation in both research and education, I have a proven track record of cross-functional collaboration and impactful contributions to the scientific community. Explore my site to learn more about my research, publications, and professional journey.
