## Motivation

If you know me, you know I like using <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> for just about anything. When it was time to create my first academic conference poster, I knew I didn't want to waste any time moving between different software environments or copy-pasting and manually formatting text, tables, figures, and results.  

Instead, I wanted to generate a fully reproducible and nicely formatted conference poster using R Markdown. Turns out; the R package [**{posterdown}**](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) makes this quite simple! In this post, I'll briefly show you how to create your own poster using the posterdown package.

For a sneak peek of what you can do with posterdown, you can [**find my first posterdown creation here**](https://sjdm.org/presentations/2021-Poster-Alzahawi-Shilaan-crowds-variability-credibility~.pdf) and the [**underlying code here**](https://github.com/shilaan/Many-Analysts/blob/main/poster/GSPA_Poster.Rmd). 

## Step 1: Install {posterdown}

First, we'll install the posterdown package.

```r
install.packages("posterdown")
```

After you've successfully installed posterdown, restart R. 

## Step 2: Open a posterdown template

After you've installed posterdown and restarted R, you should now be able to find a few new templates in your RStudio. Navigate to   
`File > New File > R Markdown ... > From Template`  
and select any of the posterdown templates.

There are three options available: Posterdown HTML, Posterdown Betterland, and Posterdown Betterport.

While the HTML template looks more like a classic scientific poster, the Betterland and Betterport templates create a poster with a large amount of space dedicated to a main take-away message. The difference between the latter two is that Better*land* is *landscape*-oriented, while Better*port* is *portrait*-oriented.  

You can find more about the different templates at the [**posterdown wiki**](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki).   

## Step 3: Personalize ‚ú®

After you've selected a template (I've gone with Posterdown HTML), you can simply üß∂ knit üß∂ it to see what the generated html document looks like. Next, you can personalize the poster to your liking, starting with the `yaml` at the top of the document (i.e., all the metadata specified between `---`, such as `title` and `author`). 

The posterdown package allows for quite a bit of customization. For example, you can set the dimensions of your poster using `poster_height` and `poster_width`; set fonts for the text and title of the poster using `font_family` and `titletext_fontfamily`; and you can set colors using `primary_colour`, `secondary_colour`, and `accent_colour`. For a comprehensive list of the `yaml` options, [**check out the Wiki of your chosen template**](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki/posterdown_html).  

### Icons 

Since we're using R Markdown to create our poster, we can use any R package to further customize it. For example, I really like to use icons, so I used the `icons` package for this. First, I installed and loaded the icons package.

```r
remotes::install_github("mitchelloharawild/icons") #install icons package
library(icons) #load icons package
```

Next, you can write inline code (code between single back ticks) to customize your poster with icons. For example,

````
`r `r ''`icons::fontawesome("github")`
````

will create an inline github icon:  
`r icons::fontawesome("github")`

If you'd like to further customize your icons, you can wrap the code above with the `icon_style()` function and pass additional comma-separated arguments, such as `scale` and `fill` to set the size and color of the icon.  
For example,    

````
`r `r ''`icon_style(icons::academicons("osf"), scale = 2, fill = "#035AA6")`
````

will create a larger OSF icon in blue:  
`r icon_style(icons::academicons("osf"), scale = 2, fill = "#035AA6")`

### CSS 

If you're like me, you might want to customize your poster even more. In that case, posterdown allows you to pass a `css` file with further customizations. For example, as you may have noticed from spending more than 5 seconds on my website, [**I really like this color**](https://www.colorhexa.com/035aa6). I wanted all my bold text to show up in this color, so I did the following two things:

#### Create a css file with further customizations

First, I created a `style.css` file in my working directory (i.e., the place where my `.Rmd` is located). In this css file, I specified my preferred color for bold text: 

```css
:root {
  --text-bold-color: #035AA6;
}

strong {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: var(--text-bold-color);
}
```

#### Reference the css file in the `yaml`

After creating my `style.css` file in the working directory, I referenced it in the metadata of my `Rmd`:


```yaml
output: 
  posterdown::posterdown_html:
    self_contained: true
    css: style.css
```

Et voil√†! My bolded text is now in [**my favorite shade of blue**](https://www.colorhexa.com/035aa6). 


## Step 4: Share üì°

You will likely want to share your poster with an external audience; to do so, it helps to create a self-contained document by setting `self_contained: true` under `output`. In addition, I knew that I wanted to automatically generate a PDF for sharing, so I added the following line to my `yaml`: 
```yaml
knit: pagedown::chrome_print
```

And that's it!
